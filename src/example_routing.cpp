This is an example file, do whatever you want with it! (for example if you are in Paris, invite us for a beer)

A slightly more advanced example : we want to use OSM data to extract a graph that represents the road network 

Build the example with (we're to lazy to make it compatible with older standards):
g++ example_routing.cc -O2 -losmpbf -lprotobuf -std=c++0x -o routing 
To run it:
./routing path_to_your_data.osm.pbf
